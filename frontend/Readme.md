Difference between Marketplace and Auction house

MarketPlace crates has content from 0 to item of values worth 1.5 times worth its own price

Auction House Crates has guaranteed content but the bids will increase its prices


##Business model
Users will be charged somewhere between 10 to 100 points to list their crates in MarketPlace whose price they cant list up by more than 1.5 times than value it contains, but for listing items in Auction house the price is from 100-500 points and the bidding will start at a very low price (1/10 - 1/15 price of its original price). The final bid price is the money they will end up with but with a slight deduction of transaction fees.
